Recently there has been a change in the landscape of the local Halifax branch in Hatfield by adding a new floor to the main building. The computer network of the branch needs to be expanded too. The network designer has come with the topology in Figure 1:

As a new  network engineer for this branch, you have been asked to assign the IP addresses and configure this small network for full connectivity.

To make sure that everything is tested properly before the implementation, an initial prototype was be built on Packet Tracer. We needed to configure all the LAN and WAN interfaces on routers and PCs according to the IP subnetted addresses. When all PCs could ping to their default gateways and each other from the old network to the new expansion, then this an indication that the configuration implemented was correct. 

In order to test the network yourself, you will have to download packet tracer.
